The benchmark program is "tpcc". This loads the TPC-C database with the
specified number of warehouses, then executes a number of transactions
(currently 200000). This benchmark is, I believe, a complete and correct TPC-C
implementation. There are a few noted discrepancies noted in "CHEATS". If there
are bugs, problems, fixes, or questions, please let me know.


I have another implementation that supports "locking." If you are interested
in this, talk to me.


Overview of the code:

Everything that ends in _test is a unit test to verify that the code is correct.

tpccgenerate.cc: Code for loading the database.
tpccclient.cc: Code for generating client requests.
tpccdb.h: Definitions of the tuple types and constant
tpcctables.cc: Actual implementation of the in-memory data structures and
    TPC-C stored procedures.
